# Cryptocurrency Dashboard Overview
This project is a Cryptocurrency Dashboard built using ReactJS, Redux, TailwindCSS, and Chart.js. It provides a user-friendly interface to visualize and analyze cryptocurrency data fetched from the Coingecko API.

## Technologies Used
1. ReactJS: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
2. React-redux: Official React bindings for Redux, a state management library.
3. Redux-thunk: Middleware for handling asynchronous actions in Redux.
4. TailwindCSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
5. Chart.js: A simple yet flexible JavaScript charting library.
6. React-chartjs-2: React wrapper for Chart.js for easy integration.

## Project Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run npm install to install project dependencies.
3. Follow the guidelines in the TailwindCSS Docs to set up TailwindCSS in the project.
4. Obtain an API key from Coingecko API and replace it in the code where necessary.

## Running the Project
Use npm start to run the project in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## Features
1. Real-time cryptocurrency data visualization.
2. Redux state management for efficient data handling.
3. Responsive UI design with TailwindCSS.
4. Integration of Chart.js for interactive and dynamic charts.

## Future Enhancements
1. Adding more advanced charting options.
2. Implementing additional filters for data analysis.
3. Enhancing the UI for a better user experience.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
